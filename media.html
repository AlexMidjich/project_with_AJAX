				<h3>Trivia</h3>

				<h4 id="history_show">History around the movies <b class="caret"></b></h4>
					<article id="history_hide">
						<p>The Star Wars universe is centered around a timeline that was established after the battle of Yavin. When you read about events in Star Wars you will most likely encounter the concept "BBY" (Before Battle of Yavin) and "ABY" (After Battle of Yavin). The battle of Yavin takes place in the movie "A new hope" where the rebel alliance manage to destroy the Death Star</p>
						<p>The first chapter in the saga "The Phantom Menace" takes place approximately 32 BBY. The second chapter "Attack of the Clones" occurs around 22 BBY. The third chapter "Revenge of the Sith" occurs 19 BBY and that is also the year when Luke Skywalker is born.</p>
						<p>The original trilogy, starting with "A new Hope" takes place 0 BBY. This is when we first encounter Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacka och Princess Leia Organa. At the end of this movie we can follow the assault on the Death Star at the battle of Yavin. "The Empire strikes back" is set 3 ABY. The movie starts with the Empires attack on the rebel bace on Hoth. Luke Skywalker finds Yoda and starts his Jedi training. Only one year after, 4 ABY, "The Return of the Jedi" takes place. Luke Skywalker with the help of his father, Darth Vader (also known as Anakin Skywalker), defeats the Emperor, Darth Sidius.</p>
						<p>The latest movie in the saga "The Force Awakens" takes place 34 ABY. There is once again an evil force in the galaxy, "The first order" who’s leader is supreme Leader Snoke. The first order is allied with the "Knights of Ren" which is a organization of dark sided force sensetives. One member of the Knights of Ren that we encounter is Kylo Ren, also known as Ben Solo. Next chapter in the saga is planed for 2017.</p>

				<h4 id="jedi_show">Jedi <b class="caret"></b></h4>
					<article id="jedi_hide">
						<p>The Jedi is an ancient order of force sensitives that was formed around 10 000 BBY. The Jedi order represents the light side of the force and they are dedicated on maintaining peace in the galaxy. The Jedis headquarters were the Jedi Temple situated on Corucant. A Jedis first-hand weapon is a Lightsaber, a sword created out of energy from the rare Kyber crystals. there are different ranks in the Jedi Order.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Jedi Younglings</li>
							<p>This is the first step at becoming a Jedi. The Jedi order travels across the galaxy to find young child’s that are force sensitive. They are then brought to the Jedi temple on Corucant where they will be trained in the ways of the Jedi. When the younglings are ready they are to participate in "The gathering" a pilgrimate to the Temple of Ilum where they would obtain their Kyber crystal for their lightsaber.</p>
							<li>Padawan</li>
							<p>When a youngling is chosen from a Jedi Knight to become tutored he earns the rank of Padawan. Before anyone can become a Padawan they must first pass the Initiate trials. All Padawans wore a braid just to be distinguished from a Jedi. During the Clone wars Padawans could be given the title Jedi Commander if they’d partaked in the wars together with their Jedi Knight or Jedi Master.</p>
							<li>Jedi Knight</li>
							<p>To become a Jedi Knight a Padawan must first pass the Jedi trials. The Jedi trials consists of nine steps: Teamwork, isolation, fear, anger, betrayal, focus, instinct, forgiveness and protection. Once a Jedi Knight you were allowed to go on missions on your own and also to tutor your own Padawan. During the Clone wars for those Jedi Knights and Jedi Master that was given a commanding roles in the Republic army also had the title of Jedi Generals.</p>
							<li>Jedi Master</li>
							<p>To become a Jedi Master the Jedi Knight must first show great skill and devotion to the force. Also when a Jedi Knight successfully trained a Padawan to reach the rank of a Jedi Knight they would be offered the title of Jedi Master. As a Jedi Master you could also be offered a seat in the Jedi High Council.</p>
							<li>Grand Master</li>
							<p>The Grand Master is the leader of the Jedi Order. This title was given to the Orders oldest and wisest member.</p>

				<h4 id="sith_show">Sith <b class="caret"></b></h4>
					<article id="sith_hide">
						<p>The Sith Order was founded almost the same time as the Jedi Order. The Siths are also force sensitives but instead of dedicating their lives to the light they instead seek the power of darkness and destruction. The Sith Order was formed from a renegade Jedi that sought more knowledge. At the beginning the ranks of the Siths was massive, they had settled on the planet Moraband where they constructed temples and tombs filled with knowledge of the dark side. From there they waged war against the galaxy and the Jedi order.</p>
						<p>The Jedi and the Sith have always been in war with each other. What eventually led to the downfall for the Siths was the dark side and the hunger for more power that it led to. The Siths turned on each other which made their ranks smaller and the Jedi Order could eventually bring the Siths down. However one Sith lord survived, Darth Bane. After the downfall of the Siths, Darth Bane established the Rule of Two, meaning that there could only be two Siths at the same time, the Sith lord and his apprentice.</p>
						<p>It wasn't until 4 ABY that the Sith Order ended with the death of Darth Sidius, the Emperor, and his apprentice, Darth Vader. However, the dark side still exists and lives on through other fractions, such as the Knights of Ren.</p>
