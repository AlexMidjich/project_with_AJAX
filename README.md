<h3>Product</h3>

<p>My project is a fanpage for star wars. As user you can get information about movies, characters, planets and species. It's even a section were you can test your knowledge with a quiz.<p>

<h3>Technologies used for this project:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Html</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Bootstrap / Mediaquerys</li>
<li>Jquery</li>
<li>Ajax</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
</ul>

<h3>API</h3>

<p>https://swapi.co/</p>

<p>Swapi is a API with collected data from the Star Wars universe.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>

<p>This site is devloped to work on diferent screen sizes. In my process when making a website I often start with the functionality for desktop users, when I got that covered I start to adjust the site for other devices.</p> 


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>All in all I would say that this is a highly functionated site. During the work with the site I realy learned and understod the way AJAX works. And by building this site I also used the technoliges I already lernt from before and I feel more comfortable working with both js and jquery after this project. What I have improved from my previous project is to clear my html from any js-code.</p>

<p>What I can improve not just with this site but in general is to get a deeper knowledge for javascript, take for example the quiz-section. Instead of using "prompt" I would like to print out the questions directly on the page.</p>
